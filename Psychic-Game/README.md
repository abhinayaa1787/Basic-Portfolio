# Psychic-Game
This is a page where user inputs a letter and checks whether it is matched with the letter guessed by the computer.
to design this page used 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
#### HTML page
This has all the contents the users needs to see. This is the layout that appears on screen.

#### CSS 
This has the styles that are applied to the page

#### Javascript behind the page explained:
* The user inputs a letter and it is stored as a variable.
* The computer guesses a random letter from an array of 26 alphabets using Random() and is stored as a variable.
* Then both the variables are compared to see if they are equal.
* If yes, the user wins and the win counter increments else the loss counter increments.
* The letters that are typed in by the user will be listed as an array of guesses.
* The results are injected to the page on runtime.
* The user input is restricted to certain times and when the user inputs  greater than that number then the page reloads.
